About this repository
=====================

This is where I keep my dotfiles synchronized. I use them over several
machines (some I own, some I don't own) so they should be kind of
portable.

How to deploy
=============

If you like this stuff, you should be interested in knowing about the way
I deploy it. I use the makefile:
- 'make' or 'make install':
  Makes symbolic links '~/.file -> /abs/path/to/file' for every file of
  this repository (except this README, the Makefile and the versioning
  files).
- 'make clean' or 'make uninstall':
  Erases '~/.file' for every file of this repository (except this README,
  the Makefile and the versioning files).

Have fun reading this!
