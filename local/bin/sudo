# This script must live in a directory which has higher priority than the
# one of sudo. Typically, ~/.local/bin will do the trick.

# It is meant to leverage pass (see https://www.passwordstore.org/) in
# order to give the password to sudo: if a yubikey is plugged in, it will
# call `sudo --askpass`, and use the wrapper sudo-askpass, as the program
# to read the password from. Otherwise it falls back to the real sudo.
# You are expected to provide this wrapper in the PATH.

# First, get the real sudo by searching the path stripped from the
# directory of this script
